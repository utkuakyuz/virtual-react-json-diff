A high-performance React component for visually comparing large JSON objects. Built on top of [json-diff-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-diff-kit), this viewer supports:

- Virtual scrolling for better performance (especially for large diffs)
- Custom theming (Soon new themes will be available)
- Dual Mini Map
- üîç Search functionality
- ‚öõÔ∏è Optimized for React (uses `react-window`)

This component is developed for dealing with thousands of lines of Json Files, and seamlessly compare then render them on UI. Json Compare is a concept that has insufficient FE components available. This component brings solution to the issues of current diff viewers. Virtualized scroll gives a smooth experience while dual minimap and search ability simplifies the process of comparing JSON objects.

## Features

- **Compare Large JSON Objects** ‚Äì Handles big files without freezing the UI
- **Virtualized Rendering** ‚Äì Efficient DOM updates using `react-window`
- **Search Highlighting** ‚Äì Find matches and scroll directly to them
- **Mini Map** ‚Äì Dual scrollable minimap of Json Diff, scaled to better see comparison result
- **Customizable Styles** ‚Äì Add your own class names and styles easily (checkout JsonDiffCustomTheme.css)

## Usage

Modify DifferOptions and InlineDiffOptions and see the output.

Dual Minimap is defaultly shown, to hide middle minimap, just pass ShowSingleMinimap prop to Viewer.

To change Diff methods please see DifferOptions. By default virtual-react-json-diff uses following configuration.

```
new Differ({
  detectCircular: true,
  maxDepth: 20,
  showModifications: true,
  arrayDiffMethod: "lcs",
  preserveKeyOrder: "before",
  ...differOptions,
}),
```

Simply pass your json objects into Viewer Component. It will find differences and show.

```
import React from "react";
import { VirtualDiffViewer } from "virtual-react-json-diff";

const oldData = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const newData = { name: "Alice", age: 26, city: "NYC" };

export default function App() {
  return (
    <VirtualDiffViewer
      oldValue={oldData}
      newValue={newData}
      height={600}
      className="my-custom-diff"
    />
  );
}
```

The component exposes a root container with the class:

```
<div class="diff-viewer-container">...</div>
```

You can pass your own class name via the className prop to apply custom themes.
